# UI-UX Basic Principles

0. “Don't Make Me Think” (your interface should be so intuitive that users don’t have to figure things out.)
— Steve Krug

1. "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."
— Steve Jobs

2. "People ignore design that ignores people."
— Frank Chimero

3. "If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design."
— Ralf Speth, Jaguar CEO

4. "Good design is as little design as possible."
— Dieter Rams

5. "Usability is not only about ease of use but also about bringing something meaningful, having an impact on people’s lives."
— UX Booth

6. "A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good."
— Martin LeBlanc

7. "You’re not your users."
— UX Rule #1

8. "The details are not the details. They make the design."
— Charles Eames

9. "Your job is to figure out what your users want before they do."
— Don Norman

10. "Make it simple, but significant."
— Don Draper (Mad Men)

11. "Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration."
— Jeffrey Zeldman

12. "The best products don’t focus on features, they focus on clarity."
— Jason Fried

13. "Every great design begins with an even better story."
— Lorinda Mamo

14. "In design, there are no shortcuts to great results."
— Unknown

15. "UX is about how it works. UI is about how it looks."
— Common industry wisdom

## Part 1: Core Visual Design Principles (UI Basics)

These form the foundation of visual layout, used by every designer and frontend developer:

- Visual Hierarchy – Guide attention using size, color, position.
- Balance – Distribute elements evenly (symmetrical/asymmetrical).
- Contrast – Differentiate elements with color, shape, size.
- Alignment – Keep elements visually connected.
- Proximity – Group related items together.
- Repetition / Consistency – Repeat styles for familiarity.
- White Space – Use empty space to reduce clutter.
- Scale & Proportion – Size elements according to importance.
- Typography – Use readable fonts, proper hierarchy.
- Color Theory – Use colors purposefully for emotion & usability.

## Part 2: UX Principles (User Behavior & Interaction Design)

These focus on creating interfaces that are usable, friendly, and purpose-driven:

- User-Centered Design – Design for real user needs, not just visuals.
- Affordance – Make functionality obvious (e.g., buttons look clickable).
- Feedback – Show system response (e.g., spinners, alerts).
- Simplicity – Remove unnecessary complexity.
- Consistency – Keep design patterns uniform across screens.
- Accessibility (A11y) – Make designs usable for everyone (color contrast, screen readers).
- Usability – Ensure tasks are intuitive and efficient.
- Error Prevention/Recovery – Prevent mistakes, give helpful error messages.
- Progressive Disclosure – Reveal information only when needed.
- Hick’s Law – Fewer choices = faster decisions.
- Fitts’s Law – Bigger & closer targets are easier to click/tap.

## Part 3: Advanced, Web-Specific & Strategic Principles

These help with responsive design, performance, cognitive psychology, and product thinking:

- Responsiveness – Layout adapts across devices.
- Mobile-First Design – Start from smallest screens and scale up.
- Performance Optimization – Fast load = better UX (optimize assets).
- Navigation Design – Keep menus intuitive and accessible.
- Content First – Structure meaningful content before UI polish.
- Z-Pattern / F-Pattern Layout – Align with how people scan screens.
- Gestalt Principles – Human perception rules (similarity, closure, continuity).
- Miller’s Law – Limit visible choices to 7±2 items.
- Zeigarnik Effect – Users remember incomplete actions better.
- Peak-End Rule – People remember the most intense & final parts.
- Microinteractions – Small delightful animations (e.g., heart pulse on like).
- Component-Based Design / Atomic Design – Reusable and modular UI elements.
- Design Systems – Centralized design language (e.g., Material, HIG).
- Emotional Design – Design to make users feel something (joy, trust, delight).
